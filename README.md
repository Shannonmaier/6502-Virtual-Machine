## MY DEVELOPMENT OF A 6502 PROCESSOR
- Virtual 6502 processor written in TypeScript and running on server-side Javascript using Node.js.  This project is the practical component of my Computer Organization and Architecture class.  
- Developed a deep understanding of how the machine works. There is no better way to learn how computers actually work than to build one!
- Learned how to write and implement machine instructions to run on my processor.

## HOW TO USE/HOW PROGRAMS ARE RUN
- In the system class, one can write a program in 6502 instruction, hexadecimal format that will be loaded to memory and run in steps by the CPU. The sample program outputs "Hello World." Some other sample programs are provided below.

## SAMPLE PROGRAMS
